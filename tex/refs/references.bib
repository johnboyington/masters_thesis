One of the possible methods is based on the measurement of thermal neutrons in a moderation environment, which enables the evaluation of neutron flux in a group structure and also neutron dose. The advantage of such a spectrometer consists of the fact that 90% response intervals of the spheres continuously cover the epithermal part of the neutron energy range. The method has been applied to characterize the epithermal neutron beams at several research centers in USA, Finland, the Netherlands and Czech Republic. The comparison of the MIT FCB, HFR HB11, VTT FiR, and LVR-15 beam parameters is presented in this paper.},

abstract={This paper describes the measurement campaign held around the neutron radiography (NR) facility of the Algerian 1 MW NUR research reactor.

The main objective of this work is to characterize accurately the neutron beam provided at one of the radial channels of the NUR research reactor taking benefit of the acquired CRNA Bonner spheres spectrometer (BSS). The specific objective was to improve the image quality of the NR facility. The spectrometric system in use is based on a central spherical 3He thermal neutron proportional counter combined with high density polyethylene spheres of different diameters ranging from 3 to 12 in. This counting system has good gamma ray discrimination and is able to cover an energy range from thermal to 20 MeV. The measurements were performed at the sample distance of 0.6 m from the beam port and at a height of 1.2 m from the facility floor. During the BSS measurements, the reactor was operating at low power (100 W) to avoid large dead times, pulse pileup and high level radiation exposures, in particular, during spheres handling.

Thereafter, the neutron spectrum at the sample position was unfolded by means of GRAVEL and MAXED computer codes. The thermal, epithermal and fast neutron fluxes, the total neutron flux, the mean energy and the Cadmium ratio (RCd) were provided. A sensitivity analysis was performed taking into account various defaults spectra and ultimately a different response functions in the unfolding procedure. Overall, from the obtained results it reveals, unexpectedly, that the measured neutron spectrum at the sample position of the neutron radiography of the NUR reactor is being harder with a predominance of fast neutrons (>100 keV) by about 60%. Finally, those results were compared to previous and more recent measurements obtained by activation foils detectors. The agreement was fairly good highlighting thereby the consistency of our findings.},

annote={Cd used for both Bare detector and 3'' sphere. Uncertainty analysis was done quantitatively. Several spectra were unfolded and their properties were compared. Among them, a ``most likely'' spectrum was chosen to represent the beam. Results were compared with previous works using foil activation for detection ($^{197}$Au, $^{115}$In, and $^{58}$Ni). They described in the future work section a neutron filter meant to correct beam-hardening effects from the spectra.}

annote={Use of a bonner sphere spectrometer was first documented in 1960 by Bramblett et al. Au and In are the typical passive detection materials and are useful because they are insensitive to gamma rays. Cd is often wrapped around detector to provide responses that are different from the standard polyethylene spheres; however, it is hard to generate response functions for these. The rank of the response function matrix gives information on the number of useful responses that you can extract form the set. MCNP is described as the best method to developing response functions. Response functions are highly sensitive to polyethylene density. Unfolding codes should never be used as a black box, rather, to be used properly, much should be known {\it a priori} about the solution spectrum to guarantee a meaningful result.}

abstract={Multisphere neutron spectrometers with active thermal neutron detectors cannot be used in high-intensity radiation fields due to pulse pile-up and dead-time effects. Thus, a multisphere spectrometer using a passive detection system, specifically gold foils, has been investigated in this work. The responses of a gold-foil-based Bonner sphere neutron spectrometer were studied for two different gold-foil holder designs; an aluminium-polyethylene holder and a polyethylene holder. The responses of the two designs were calculated for four incident neutron beam directions, namely, parallel, perpendicular and at ± 45° relative to the flat surface of the foil. It was found that the use of polyethylene holder resulted in a more isotropic response to neutrons for the four incident directions considered. The computed responses were verified by measuring the neutron spectrum of a 252Cf source with known strength.},

abstract = "Bonner Sphere Spectrometer (BSS) equipped with passive detectors are used to replace active BSS in radiation environment characterized by high fluence rate, large photon background and pulsed time structure as those encountered near particle accelerators. In this work a newly developed passive Bonner Sphere Spectrometer, using Dysprosium activation foils as central detectors (Dy-BSS), was tested through comparison with a well-established active BSS. As a suitable neutron field, where both systems can correctly operate, the 2.5MeV quasi mono-energetic beam of the ENEA Frascati Neutron Generator (FNG) was chosen. The two spectrometers are based on substantially different operation principles, therefore their response matrix are very different. In addition, the BSS are independently calibrated in different reference neutron fields. The exercise took place at 90° and at a fixed distance from the neutron emitting deuterated target. As reference data, the results obtained by unfolding the active BSS data were used. The FRUIT unfolding code, ver. 5 was used. The results of the Dy-BSS are fully comparable with those of the active BSS, in terms of both total fluence and shape of the neutron spectra. For the energy range studied in this exercise, the expected level of accuracy of the Dy-BSS and its suitability for operational neutron monitoring are fully confirmed.",
annote={Activation detectors are limited to fluences higher than $10^3-10^4$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$. Uncertainty analysis was done by selecting a large number (~10$^{3}$) of responses distributed within gaussian statistics from the recorded response and then unfolded with each of those values to obtain the distribution of the results. An equation was also used to find the total fluence as obtained from each sphere individually to see if the value was about the same for each sphere. }

  abstract = "An analysis of activation foils from irradiations at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) was used to provide a basis for determination of combined proton and neutron fluxes. Materials samples were irradiated in the A-6 target area at LANSCE to explore the mechanical property changes in a high-energy proton/spallation neutron environment. Proper assessment of the effects of irradiation required quantifying the proton and neutron fluences. Foil stacks consisting of disks of Co, Ni, Fe, Al, Nb and Cu, were irradiated concurrently with mechanical property samples. The irradiation consisted of an 800 MeV, 1 mA proton beam, and a W target in the beam provided a source of spallation neutrons. The maximum proton fluence was 4×1021 p/cm2 and the maximum neutron fluence was approximately 1×1021 n/cm2. After irradiation, the foils were withdrawn and the radioactive isotopes sampled with gamma spectroscopy. Initial calculated estimates of the fluences we made with the Los Alamos High-Energy Transport (LAHET) Code System (LCS). The LCS code is a coupling of LAHET and MCNP (Monte Carlo N-Particle) to calculate transport of the high-energy protons, neutrons and photons. From the initial estimates and the measured activation products, STAYSL2 was used to produced a revised spectra of proton and neutron fluences. STAYSL2 is an extension of the STAY'SL code normally used for neutron activation analysis. STAYSL2 has been modified to include proton fluences in the analysis of activation to account for the mixed proton/neutron fluence in the target area. This methodology was applied to multiple foil stacks from different regions of the target in order to profile the spatial dependencies of the fluences.",
