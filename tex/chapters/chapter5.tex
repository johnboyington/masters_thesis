\section{Conclusions}
%% concise statements about your main findings, related to your aims/objectives/hypothesis.
% it's possible to simulate the beam w/ advantg
First, through the assistance of the VR methods described, it is possible to find the neutron spectrum for a collimated reactor beam port.
% a high resolution flux was obtained via simulation
A high resolution flux spectrum was obtained via Monte Carlo simulation for the KSU TRIGA Mark II's Northeast Beam Port featuring dimensional data in energy, angle, and the radial direction.
% two separate experiments showed data that agreed with the shape of the simulation work and showed similar magnitude differences
Two separate experiments were conducted which collected data that demonstrated decent shape-agreeance with the simulated spectrum and differed in magnitude from the simulated work by similar values.
% successful tuning of spectrum led to a set of solution spectra that is consistent with experimental data
Successful deconvolution using the experimental data led to a set of solution spectra that is consistent with a typical reactor spectrum shape, the original simulated spectrum shape, and the experimental data.
% the shape looks softer than originally hypothesized, resembling an in-core neutron flux
The final shape of the spectrum doesn't match the original hypothesis of being predominately fast, but rather resembles an in-core neutron flux.
% the beam is functionally monodirectional
The final flux is approximately monodirectional.
% a significant majority of the flux is departing from inside the collimator
Also, a significant majority of the flux departing from the beam port lives with the void of the collimator.
