\section{Experimental Procedures}


\subsection{Gold Foil Tube}

% foils were individually weighed and included in table
% the device was assembled
% outer shielding was removed from the beam port configuration
% the devices was attempted to fit into the beam port but deformation prevented insertion
% the device was ground down to fit in and inserted to where the first piece was in line with the aperture of the collimator
% then, the reactor was powered on to __ kwth
% the reactor remained at power for __ hours
% then the reactor was shut down
% after allowing the device to cool for a bit, the individual foils were removed and bagged
% foils were moved to an individual counting station where they were counted (gamma spec)

\subsection{Bonner Sphere Spectrometer}

% for the bonner spheres, the device was placed vertically in a manner that aligned the detection crystal with the beam at a distance of ___ cm
% the detector was set to aquire for __ s, and then the reactor was brought to __ kwth.
% the lld setting was adjusted to where the noise could be removed, but the lithium,T peak wasn't affected
% spectra were aquired for each configuration
% the reactor was then powered off
