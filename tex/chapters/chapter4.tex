% postprocessing includes taking the measured activities and converting them to saturation activities
% this is done using the following equation

% how to get saturation activities
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:a_sat}
A_{sat} = A_{meas} \frac{R_{meas} R_{sat}}{n_a K I_{rel}}
\end{equation}

% where, (explain these terms)

% give the term and explain for r_meas

% explain the concept of saturation ratio
% this is the big one
