\section{Experimental Procedures}


\subsection{Gold Foil Tube}

% foils were individually weighed and included in table
First, the foils were individually weighted and those values are shown in \TAB{tab:au_masses}.
% the device was assembled
% outer shielding was removed from the beam port configuration
% the devices was attempted to fit into the beam port but deformation prevented insertion
% the device was ground down to fit in and inserted to where the first piece was in line with the aperture of the collimator
% then, the reactor was powered on to __ kwth
% the reactor remained at power for __ hours
% then the reactor was shut down
% after allowing the device to cool for a bit, the individual foils were removed and bagged
% foils were moved to an individual counting station where they were counted (gamma spec)


% this contains all of the advantg parameters
\begin{table}[h]\centering
\label{tab:au_masses}
\caption{The masses of the gold foils.}
\begin{tabular}{ r | r | l }
\toprule
Foil ID  & Position (in.)     &   Foil Mass (g)\\
2 & 0 & 0.0320\\
13 & 1 & 0.0312\\
4 & 2 & 0.0320\\
5 & 3 & 0.0318\\
6 & 4 & 0.0319\\
7 & 5 & 0.0325\\
8 & 6 & 0.0326\\
9 & 7 & 0.0320\\
10 & 8 & 0.0318\\
11 & 9 & 0.0326\\
12 & 10 & 0.0317\\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Bonner Sphere Spectrometer}

% for the bonner spheres, the device was placed vertically in a manner that aligned the detection crystal with the beam at a distance of ___ cm
% the detector was set to aquire for __ s, and then the reactor was brought to __ kwth.
% the lld setting was adjusted to where the noise could be removed, but the lithium,T peak wasn't affected
% spectra were aquired for each configuration
% the reactor was then powered off
