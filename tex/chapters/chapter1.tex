\chapter{Introduction and Background}



\section{Establish Territory}
%% state the general topic and give some background

%% provide a review of the literature related to the topic

%% define the terms and scope of the topic



\section{Establish a Niche}
%% outline the current situation
% mention the mark ii reactor
% mention the beam ports
% initial flux characterization f/t ratio, flux
% since then, geometry of the beam port has changed significantly
% the core has also underwent change, fuel rod positions, burnup

%% evaluate the current situation (advantages/disadvantages) and identify the gap
% this leaves a gap because the flux departing is unknown
% the changes in the collimator are likely to have had a significant effect on both the flux(E,theta,etc.) and the absolute flux
% there is minimal simulation work and experimental work that has been documented that characterizes this
% experiments have to do flux characterizations every time they experiment, and don't have a reliable source term or a good idea for the f/t ratio, which is important for testing fast detectors, etc.
% although you can use a meter to check the dose, there's still a radiological hazard anytime you deal with an unknown source



\section{Introduce the Current Research}
%% identify the importance of the proposed research
% it's important then, to do a full characterization of this beam port to fill this gap
% a better understanding would increase our capabilities for experiments, inform experimental modeling, and improve the safety of beam port use

%% state the research problem/questions
% the research quesiton is, what is coming out of the beam port
% is it possible to build a model to simulate it, then conduct an experiment to validate that model
% is it possible to accurately capture the radial, spectral, and angular distributions of this flux

%% state the research aims and/or research objectives
% the research aims to compute this flux, with all dimensions, with a very high fidelity
% then, the goal is to verify the flux values using experimental spectrometric techniques

%% state the hypothese

%% outline the order of information in the thesis

%% outline the methodology
