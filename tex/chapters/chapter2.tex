%When measuring charged particles, the energy is directly measurable, which is nice.
%You can't do that with neutrons because they are neutral particles, which is less nice.
%Instead, most modern methods use discrete responses of individual detectors or detector configurations.

%Will talk about Bonner Spheres and Foil Activation here.
