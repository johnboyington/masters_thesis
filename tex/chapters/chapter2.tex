%% introduction
%When measuring charged particles, the energy is directly measurable, which is nice.
%You can't do that with neutrons because they are neutral particles, which is less nice.
% they generally have to be measured indirectly - a neutron reacts with something causing something else that is measureable
% several of these indirect interactions can be compiled to give information on a whole neutron spectrum
% here we will explore two common ways neutron spectra are investigated


%% bonner spheres
% a major breakthrough came in 1961 when Brablett et. al. introduced the idea of bonner spheres
% they developed an active neturon spectrometer
% here's how it works
% there's a thermal sensitive crystal at the bottom
% first, a measurement is taken in the neutron environment
% then, the smallest sphere is added
% adding this sphere does two things, absorbs thermal neutrons and downscatters faster neutrons so they can be more readily absorbed
% following the mesaurement with the sphere on, larger and larger spheres are used to produce faster and faster responses
% after taking all of these measurements, the entire spectrum has been measured
% using some math (which will be detailed in the next section) these measurements can be used to obtain the actual spectrum

%% gold foil activation
% foil activation, specifically with gold foils, is a standard way of measuring flux
% with the gold alone, only one response can measure the absolute flux
% gold is good for this for a number of reasons
% very high thermal cross section, it has a great halflife and gamma for counting and is metallic, so it can be worked into different forms
% though, gold alone cant give spectrum, there are a number of ways in which you can get one
% adding cadmium allows one to get a two group flux, since cadmium eats thermal neutrons
% gold can be used as a part of a multifoil experiment
% it has also been used with the bonner spheres to produce info from the whole spectrum
% in beam, this works
