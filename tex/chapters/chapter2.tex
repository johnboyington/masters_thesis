\section{Beam Port Characterization Experiments}

%% introduction
%When measuring charged particles, the energy is directly measurable, which is nice.
A useful effect when measuring charged particles and gamma-rays is that generally, it is possible for all of the particle's energy deposited into a detector within a relatively small time window.
%You can't do that with neutrons because they are neutral particles, which is less nice.
Neutrons, unfortunately, do not share this property with the other particle types, making the process of obtaining spectral information about some neutronic environment less straightforward.
% they generally have to be measured indirectly - a neutron reacts with something causing something else that is measureable
Instead, neutrons have to be measured indirectly - a neutron will react and produce some measureable secondary effect within a detection medium.
This effect is rarely equal to (or even proportional to) the energy of the incident neutron.
That does not mean, however, that spectral information cannot still be obtained about a neutron flux.
% several of these indirect interactions can be compiled to give information on a whole neutron spectrum
In practice, with a set of different detectors, each responding to different speeds of neutrons, a collection of measurements can be compiled to produce information on the entire spectrum.
% here we will explore two common ways neutron spectra are investigated
Here, we will explore two common ways neutorn spectra are investigated experimentally in practice.

\subsection{Bonner Sphere Spectrometer}
%% bonner spheres
% a major breakthrough came in 1961 when Brablett et. al. introduced the idea of bonner spheres
% they developed an active neturon spectrometer
% here's how it works
% there's a thermal sensitive crystal at the bottom
% first, a measurement is taken in the neutron environment
% then, the smallest sphere is added
% adding this sphere does two things, absorbs thermal neutrons and downscatters faster neutrons so they can be more readily absorbed
% following the mesaurement with the sphere on, larger and larger spheres are used to produce faster and faster responses
% after taking all of these measurements, the entire spectrum has been measured
% using some math (which will be detailed in the next section) these measurements can be used to obtain the actual spectrum

\subsection{Gold Foil Activation}
%% gold foil activation
% foil activation, specifically with gold foils, is a standard way of measuring flux
% with the gold alone, only one response can measure the absolute flux
% gold is good for this for a number of reasons
% very high thermal cross section, it has a great halflife and gamma for counting and is metallic, so it can be worked into different forms
% though, gold alone cant give spectrum, there are a number of ways in which you can get one
% adding cadmium allows one to get a two group flux, since cadmium eats thermal neutrons
% gold can be used as a part of a multifoil experiment
% it has also been used with the bonner spheres to produce info from the whole spectrum
% in beam, this works
