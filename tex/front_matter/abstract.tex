% spectral characterization was done on nebp
A high-resolution, multi-dimensional flux characterization was done for the Kansas State University TRIGA Mark II's Northeast Beam Port.
% then i added nebp to the existing ksu triga model
First, the Beam Port geometry was added to the existing reactor model.
% fission rates were tallied within the core
Then the in-core fission rates were tallied using MCNP to provide a source term for the beam transport.
% advantg was applied
The program ADVANTG was applied to the model to produce weight windows for the problem.
% tally was collected at end of beam port
A tally was then collected at the end of the beam port and results are presented.

% this tally was used to produce response functions for different detectors
Results from this tally were used to produce simulated responses and response functions for two detectors, a gold foil-based passive spectrometer and a standard set of Bonner Spheres.
% experiment done to measure flux
An experiment was conducted with both measurement devices to obtain spectral information on the flux.
% post processing done, showing decent agreeance with simulated results
These results showed decent shape agreeance and a small magnitude bias with the simulated results.
% final spectra were unfolded using methods described above and results presented
Finally, the measurements, simulated flux, and response functions were used to unfold a final set of spectra using three different unfolding techniques.
The Doroshenko directed divergence and Gravel (modified SandII) methods produced physically-realistic spectra which successfully fit the measured data, while MAXED did not.
