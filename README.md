## Master's Requirements

Info on master's requirements can be found in the [`Graduate Student Handbook`](https://www.mne.k-state.edu/docs/academics/graduate/18-19%20grad%20student%20handbook.pdf).

Requirements for Master's degree - Thesis Option


| Requirement | Statue |
|---|---|
| 1. File POS | Complete |
| 2. Minimum 18 hrs graded coursework | Complete |
| 3. Complete one engineering math course | Complete |
| 4a. Minimum 6 hours NE899| Complete |
| 4b. Defend thesis| Complete |
| 5. Minimum 18 hrs over 700 level | Complete |
| 6. No 500 level courses | Complete |
| 7. ME800 | Complete |
| 8. Total 30 credit hrs | Complete |

1. All MS students must formulate their POS in consultation with their major professor and their supervisory committee. Full-time students must file their programs before the end of their second semester of graduate study, and part-time students must do so upon the completion of 9 credit hours.

2. A minimum of 18 credit hours of graded coursework (i.e., courses in which a letter grade is assigned). 

3. The graded coursework should include at least one 3 credit hour course in engineering mathematics or applied mathematical analysis. Courses that may be used to meet this requirement are: ME 760, ME 860, MATH 616, MATH 632, MATH 713, MATH 740, MATH 745, MATH 855, MATH 856, MATH 864, MATH 865, MATH 866, MATH 867, PHYS 801, PHYS 802.

4. The candidate should earn credit for at least 6 credit hours of Master's Thesis Research (ME899 or NE 899) culminating in a successfully defended thesis.

5. At least 18 hours, of the required minimum of 30 hours, should be at the 700 level and above, including ME 800 Graduate Seminar/Research Paper, and the thesis/research and the report/problems hours required by the thesis and report options.

6. Courses at the 600-level may be included in the POS, but 500-level courses in the student's major area are expected to have been completed as undergraduate prerequisites to graduate study or as undergraduate deficiency courses assigned upon admission. The use of 500-level supporting courses in master's programs is therefore restricted as follows: (1) no course in the student's major area may be at the 500 level, and (2) normally no more than 6 credit hours may be at the 500 level.

7. The MS candidate must satisfy the 75% attendance requirement (0 credit hour) in at least two semesters of ME 800 Graduate Seminar/Research Paper, (refer to ME 800 course requirements).

8. In addition to the minimum graded coursework requirement (18 credit hours) and the minimum Master's Thesis Research requirement (6 credit hours), the candidate must complete 6 more credit hours to meet the minimum credit requirement of 30 credit hours. This can be done through any combination of the following:
    - Up to 2 additional credit hours of Master's Thesis Research (ME 899 or NE 899)
    - Up to 3 credit hours of ME 800 Seminar/Research Paper (refer to ME 800 course requirements)
    - Up to 3 credit hours of independent study 
    - Up to 6 credit hours of additional coursework
